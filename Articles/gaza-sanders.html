  <p>Netanyahu is a war criminal by the International Criminal Court for overseeing the systematic killing of civilians in Gaza. These war crimes continue to this day. Netanyahu's extremist government has killed over 38,000 people and wounded almost 135,000, 60% of whom are women, children, or elderly people, after Israel prevented any aid from entering Gaza for nearly three months. It took a private foundation to get in through a private foundation. This has been a catastrophe, with near-daily massacres at the new aid distribution sites, and almost 5000 injured while trying to access food through this mechanism. A coalition of more than 200 NGOs said last week that people in Gaza are being forced to 'starve or risk being shot while trying desperately to reach food to feed their families.' Gaza's hospitals are overwhelmed from daily massacres, in critical cases, and that medical facilities are running out of body bags. Interviewed Israeli soldiers posted to these distribution points, who say they are ordered to shoot into crowds of civilians who posed no risk. One soldier said, 'It's a killing field. Where I was stationed, between 1 and 5 people were killed every day.' Netanyahu's extremist government is also preventing baby formula, and mothers who cannot breastfeed have no alternative but to watch their children slowly starve. That Donald Trump and Congress are welcoming this week a war criminal who will be remembered as one of the monsters of the 21st century. Given the corrupt nature of the American political system, where wealthy campaign contributors are able to buy elections and heavily influence legislation, US military aid for the Netanyahu government, but that is exactly what the American people want us to do. Together, let's make it happen.
